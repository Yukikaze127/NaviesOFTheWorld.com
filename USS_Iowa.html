<h2 style = "text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>

<p>The USS Iowa (BB-61),
     the lead ship of her class, 
     is a lasting symbol of American 
     naval power and technology. She was built at 
     the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. 
     Her keel was laid down on June 27, 1940. 
     She launched on August 27, 1942, and officially 
     joined the US Navy on February 22, 1943. 
     As the first of the Navy's new class of large 
     and agile battleships for World War II, 
     the Iowa-class vessel weighed 45,000 tons and 
     measured an impressive 887 feet 3 inches in length. 
     Her crew included 151 officers and 2,637 enlisted personnel. 
     Commissioned during the peak of World War II, 
     the USS Iowa quickly became a powerful force, earning 
     11 battle stars for her service. Her early responsibilities 
     included transporting President Franklin D. Roosevelt across 
     the Atlantic to the Tehran Conference in late 1943. The USS 
     Iowa (BB-61) proudly carried the name of the great state of 
     Iowa, serving in not only World War II but also in the 
     Korean War and the Vietnam War. This history solidified her 
     legacy as a versatile and strong warship across several decades 
     of American history.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Overview</h2>
<ul style="max-width:700px; margin:24px auto; font-size:1.08em; color:#1b3b5a; line-height:1.7; font-weight:700;">
    <li><strong>Class & Type:</strong> Iowa-class battleship<br>
        → The Iowa was the first of four super-battleships built by the U.S. Navy during WWII. These were the largest, fastest, and most advanced battleships ever built by the United States.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> USS Iowa (BB-61)<br>
        → “USS” = United States Ship. “BB” = Battleship. “61” = Her hull number (61st battleship authorized by the U.S. Navy).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Namesake:</strong> State of Iowa<br>
        → U.S. Navy battleships are traditionally named after states. Iowa was the 29th state, known for its farmland and strong military tradition.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Builder:</strong> New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, NY<br>
        → Where the ship was constructed — one of the oldest and most important U.S. Navy shipyards.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Laid Down:</strong> June 27, 1940<br>
        → The day construction officially began — workers started assembling the keel (the ship’s backbone).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Launched:</strong> August 27, 1942<br>
        → The day the unfinished ship was slid into the water for the first time, often with a ceremonial bottle of champagne broken on the bow.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Commissioned:</strong> February 22, 1943<br>
        → The day the ship officially entered active service in the U.S. Navy — fully armed, crewed, and ready for duty.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Decommissioned:</strong> Last time: October 26, 1990<br>
        → The day the Navy officially retired her from active service. She was reactivated and decommissioned multiple times during her career.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Museum ship in Los Angeles, CA (since 2012)<br>
        → She’s now permanently docked at the Port of Los Angeles as a floating museum — you can tour her!
    </li>
    <li><strong>📏 Dimensions & Weight</strong>
        <ul style="font-weight:700;">
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> 887 feet 3 inches (270.4 meters)<br>
                → Longer than two and a half football fields. One of the longest battleships ever built.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Beam (Width):</strong> 108 feet 2 inches (33.0 meters)<br>
                → How wide the ship is at its widest point — important for fitting through canals and docks.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Draft:</strong> 37 feet 9 inches (11.5 meters)<br>
                → How deep the ship sits in the water. Deeper draft = needs deeper ports and can’t go into shallow areas.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong><br>
                Standard: 45,000 long tons (45,700 metric tons)<br>
                Full Load: 57,500 long tons (58,400 metric tons)<br>
                → “Displacement” = how much water the ship pushes aside when floating. Think of it as the ship’s weight. Full load includes fuel, ammo, food, and crew.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Power Output:</strong> 212,000 shaft horsepower (158,000 kW)<br>
                → Huge power — equivalent to about 1,400 modern pickup trucks combined.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 33 knots (38 mph / 61 km/h)<br>
                → Extremely fast for a battleship — faster than most WWII warships. Designed to escort fast aircraft carriers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> 14,890 nautical miles (17,140 mi / 27,580 km) at 15 knots<br>
                → Could sail halfway around the world without refueling — crucial for Pacific War operations.

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Full Breakdown</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Chapter 1</h3>
        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Construction and Commissioning</h4>
        <p>USS Iowa (BB-61), the
             lead ship of her class, was 
             born from America’s urgent naval 
             expansion under the Second Vinson Act of
              1939. Her keel was laid at the New York Naval
               Shipyard on 27 June 1940, where thousands of workers 
               labored to shape her massive hull. On 27 August 1942, 
               she slid into the East River, sponsored by Ilo Wallace, 
               wife of Vice President Henry A. Wallace. The months that
               followed saw her fitted with cutting-edge firepower,
               armor, and radar systems that made her one of the 
               fastest and most formidable battleships afloat. Finally, 
               on 22 February 1943, under Captain John L. McCrea, 
               she was commissioned into service, ready to project 
               American power across the oceans in the darkest days 
               of World War II..</p>

    style="display:block; width:100%; max-width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin:0 auto 30px auto; box-shadow:0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.10);" />

                       <h3 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Chapter 2</h3>
                       <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Design and Capabilities</h4>
                       <p>USS Iowa was not merely a warship; she was a floating fortress built for speed and power. Her main battery of nine 16-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 guns, mounted in three turrets, gave her the ability to hurl shells weighing over a ton more than 20 miles, leveling fortifications or crippling enemy vessels with a single broadside. For defense, she carried 20 5-inch dual-purpose guns, able to strike both aircraft and surface targets.

Beneath her armored decks lay eight boilers and four turbines, producing over 212,000 horsepower and driving her sleek hull to speeds above 33 knots—unheard of for battleships of her size. This blend of speed and strength earned her the nickname “fast battleship,” allowing her to keep pace with aircraft carriers.

Her armor, up to 12 inches thick at the belt, protected her vitals against enemy fire, while advanced radar and fire-control systems gave her unmatched accuracy. Housing nearly 2,800 officers and crew, Iowa was a self-sustaining city at sea, with workshops, galleys, and medical facilities to keep her fighting through long campaigns. Every aspect of her design reflected America’s determination to dominate the seas in World War II.</p>

 
 <p> USS Iowa's service record is a testament to her design and the men who served aboard her. During World War II, she participated in numerous battles, including the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where her guns silenced enemy positions and protected American forces. After the war, she was decommissioned but remained a symbol of naval power.</p>



<p>USS Iowa's post-war career was as storied as her combat service. After being decommissioned in 1949, she was reactivated during the Korean War, where she provided naval gunfire support for ground troops. Her powerful guns were instrumental in the bombardment of enemy positions, showcasing her enduring relevance on the modern battlefield.

<h3 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Chapter 3</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">WWII: Atltantic to Pacific</h4>
<p>Iowa made a strong 
    entrance early in World War 
    II, starting her service in the 
    Atlantic. In November 1943, she 
    transported President Franklin D. 
    Roosevelt across the Atlantic to North 
    Africa on the way to the Tehran Conference. 
    This significant task earned her the nickname 
    “Battleship of Presidents.”
</p>

<p>In early 1944, 
    Iowa moved to the 
    Pacific, playing a key
     role in the Marshalls campaign. 
     She shelled beachheads at Kwajalein and
      Eniwetok. She also screened fast carrier groups, 
      attacked Japanese bases at Truk, and provided fire 
      support across the Marianas, including Saipan, 
      Tinian, Guam, Peleliu, and Leyte. Her active 
      participation during the Battle of the Philippine
       Sea and Leyte Gulf highlighted her importance in America’s 
       island-hopping strategy.</p>

       <p>After an overhaul 
        in early 1945, Iowa returned for 
        the Okinawa campaign and the raids on the 
        Japanese home islands. She bombarded industrial 
        targets in Hokkaido and Honshu. Finally, she sailed 
        into Tokyo Bay as Admiral Halsey’s flagship for Japan’s 
        formal surrender on 2 September 1945. This marked a symbolic 
        end to her wartime service.</p>

        

        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Post-War and the Korean Conflict</h4>
        <p>After returning to the U.S., Iowa 
            supported post-war operations and training 
            until she was first decommissioned in March 1949. 
            The start of the Korean War brought her back. 
            She was recommissioned in August 1951 and served 
            as the Seventh Fleet flagship through 1952. During this 
            time, she carried out heavy shore bombardments against 
            enemy targets in North Korea, including Songjin and 
            Hungnam.</p>

            <p>After her Korean deployment, Iowa 
                joined the Atlantic Fleet. She went
                 on several training cruises in Europe 
                 and participated in NATO exercises. 
                 She was also present for the International 
                 Naval Review in Hampton Roads in 1957. She was 
                 decommissioned again in February 1958.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Cold War Revival: The 1980s Resurgence</h4>
                <p>After more than
                     twenty years in the 
                     reserve fleet, Iowa was brought 
                     back to service during the Reagan-era push for a 
                     600-ship Navy. She was recommissioned in April 
                     1984 and updated with modern weapons, including 
                     Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles, Phalanx CIWS, 
                     improved radar, and electronics. This reaffirmed 
                     \her role as a forward-looking deterrent in a new 
                     age of naval warfare.</p>

                     <p>Iowa sailed through European waters in the 
                        mid-1980s. She entered the Mediterranean and 
                        later the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, 
                        representing American power and determination 
                        during increased East-West tensions.</p>

                        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: #1b3b5a;">Tragedy and Final Decommissioning</h4>

                        <p>The resurgence came with tragedy. 
                            On 19 April 1989, during a gunnery 
                            exercise, an explosion inside her No. 
                            2 turret killed 47 sailors. This was 
                            one of the Navy’s deadliest peacetime 
                            disasters. While the official Navy 
                            investigation blamed sabotage, many have 
                            debated this conclusion. Independent 
                            reviews have suggested other possible 
                            causes.</p>

                            <p>Despite the incident, Iowa continued
                                 with limited deployments but was 
                                 decommissioned for the last time in 
                                 October 1990. She remained in reserve 
                                 until being removed from the Naval 
                                 Vessel Register in 2006.</p>

<p>In 2011, the Pacific Battleship Center received the Iowa. 
    By 2012, she had secured a permanent spot at Berth 87 in the 
    Port of Los Angeles. After opening to the public, she became the 
    Battleship USS Iowa Museum. This museum educates visitors and 
    stands as an important piece of naval history. Today, she is the 
    main attraction of the National Museum of the Surface Navy and a 
    highlight of Los Angeles Fleet Week.</p>

    <p>Visitors and veterans reflect on her legacy not just as
         a massive vessel of steel and firepower, but also as a 
         symbol of service, sacrifice, and changing purpose.</p>
